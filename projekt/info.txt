	Brownian motion or pedesis is the random motion of particles suspended
in afluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast
moving molecules in the fluid.
	This pattern of motion typically alternates random fluctuations in a
particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain with a relocation to another
sub-domain. Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new
closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined
by a given temperature.
